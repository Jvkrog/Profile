 //JVKROG — Autonomous Systems & Decision Engineering//

This repository documents my journey in building **autonomous and semi-autonomous systems** across embedded hardware, IoT, and algorithmic decision-making.

Rather than focusing on final outcomes alone, this project emphasizes:
- system behavior
- failure-driven iteration
- explainable decisions
- reduction of human dependency in critical moments

// Each project follows a common philosophy:

> **Observe → Decide → Act**

Failures are intentionally preserved and documented, as they directly shaped later design choices.

// Project Areas

//  Embedded & Robotics
- **WiFi Car (ESP32-CAM Rover)**  
  Real-time video streaming and web-based remote control.

- **FireBot **  
  Mobile fire detection with IoT-based monitoring.

- **Smart Wrist Band**  
  Wearable safety system with fall detection, Blynk dashboard, and Telegram alerts.

---

//  Algorithmic Decision Systems
- **Trading Algorithm (TAlgo)**  
  A rule-based trading system built to reduce emotional decision-making such as fear, greed, and revenge trading.

  Each version exists because the previous one failed under specific market conditions.  
  Strategies are documented as evolving experiments rather than fixed solutions.

// Design Philosophy

- Prefer **simple, explainable logic** over complex black-box systems
- Treat emotions as **system bugs**, not personal flaws
- Accept that *no action* is also a valid decision
- Build systems that can explain **why** a decision was made

---

// Why This Repository Exists

Most projects focus on success stories.  
This repository focuses on **learning through failure** and building systems that become more robust over time.

The goal is not optimization at any cost, but **clarity, stability, and purpose-driven automation**.

---

// Future Direction
- AI-assisted explanation layers for decision systems
- Autonomous robotics with reasoning logs
- Purpose-driven AI: systems that explain their actions, not just execute them
